# Dart Bug: Improper JSON Handling and Missing Key Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving JSON handling and the potential for missing keys in the response.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that lacks robust error handling.  The improved version in `bugSolution.dart` addresses these issues for a more robust and reliable application.

## Bug Description
The original code attempts to fetch data from an API endpoint.  It assumes the response is always a valid JSON object containing a specific key ('key' in this example).  If the API returns an error, or the 'key' is missing, the application throws an exception or produces unexpected results. This example demonstrates how to properly handle potential errors during JSON parsing and missing keys.

## Solution
The solution involves thorough error handling for both HTTP errors and JSON parsing failures.  The improved code carefully checks the response status code, verifies that the response body is valid JSON, and checks for the existence of the key before accessing it.  This approach prevents unexpected crashes and improves the reliability of the application.
